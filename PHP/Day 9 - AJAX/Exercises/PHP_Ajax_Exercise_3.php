	-- Exercice : 

	In this exercise, we will continue the login/register process.


	- Step 1 :
		When a user login, do an AJAX Call to do the checks and validations.
		Display a corresponding message (green/red).

	- Step 2 :
		Do the same when a user is registering.


	Now, your login/register process should use full Ajax to do validations.
