	-- Exercice : 

	In this exercise, you will use the 'moviedb' database.

	Create a new file called 'search.html'.
	In this file, create a form with only one input (search textbox).
	This input will be use to search for a movie.

	Each time the user press a key :
		- Results are shown as the user type
		- Results narrow as he continue typing
		- If results become too narrow, remove characters to see a broader result

	To achieve this you should create a php file ('search-movie.php'). 
	This PHP file looks for a movie with specific characters and return an array of movies.
