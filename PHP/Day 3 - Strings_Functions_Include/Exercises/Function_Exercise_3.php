-- Exercise 1 : 
	Write a function 'isOrder' that :
		- Take one array of integer as argument
		- Checks if the elements of the arrays are ordered in ascending order.

-- Exercise 2 :

	Write a function 'orderArray' that :
		- Take one array of integer as argument
		- Return an array which was ordered

-- Exercise 3 :

	Write a function that : 
		- Take one float $x as argument
		- Get the integer part of a positive number ($x)
		- Return this integer part

	Example :
		integerPart(5.26) // return 5
		integerPart(10.76) // return 10

-- Exercise 4 :

	We have an array of integers, positive, between 1 and $nbElements (nbElements is the number of elements, you can use this variable).

	Write a function call 'FizzBuzz'.
	For each number 'n' of the list, we want the following operations:
		. if the number is divisible by 3 : display 'Fizz'
		. if the number is divisible by 5 : display 'Buzz'
		. if the number is divisible by 3 AND by 5 : display 'FizzBuzz'
		. else : display the number 'n'
