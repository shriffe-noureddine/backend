/*

	1. Create an HTML form with a text field in a PHP script. The form will point to the same page.

	2. Create a `submit` button that sends the string input, and displays in a <div> this string in uppercase.

	3. Create a second `submit` button, which displays the string entered in lowercase

	4. Similarly, a submit to add a capital letter to each word
	
	5. And again a submit to add a capital letter, but only at the beginning of the chain.

	6. Now create a submit that will display the string only up to the '.' (point) not included
	  - Use the `explode` function for that.
	  - Now use the `strpos` and` substr` function to produce the same result.

	Bonus: Finally, create a submit that displays the first two words of the string entered, separated by a hyphen ("-")
  	If there are not enough words, display the message "Enter at least two words"
