	- Exercise 3 : 

		We already have two arrays :
	    $artists = array(
	        0 => array("Eminem", "IAM"), 
	        1 => array("Madonna", "Katy Perry"), 
	        2 => array("Pink Floyd", "AC/DC")

	        1 => "Pop", 
	        2 => "Rock"

 		Write a PHP script which merge the two arrays to have a single array looking like this :

		    $array3 =  array (      
		        "Rap" => Array (          
		            [0] => "Eminem",

	- Final exercise - ONLY FOR THE BEASTS

		We have an array of integers, unsorted, with all numbers from 1 to 50 BUT one element is missing (the array is therefore 49).
		
		The goal is to find the missing item (the missing number).
		However, you have 3 constraints:
		- You have the right to LOOP the array only once!
		- You have the right to use only one variable!
		- You can not use functions (sorting etc ...)

		An example with an array with 9 elements :

			$array = array(5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 6 ,8, 4, 10);
	        // Le nombre manquant est 7

	        $var = ...

	        for (int i = 0; i < count($array); ++i)
	        {
	            ...
	        }

	        echo "Missing number is: " . $var;
