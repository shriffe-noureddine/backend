        In this exercise we will implements the cart for a user.

		- Step 1 :
			Create an new item in your nav/menu looking like this : cart(x)
			x will be the number of products in your cart.

        - Step 2 :
	        Edit the page 'products.php'.
	        On every product, add a button 'Add to cart'.

        - Step 3 :
	        Create an AJAX call that sends informations about the product to add the product to the cart.
	        So you should have a second file named 'addToCart.php'
	        This file will take informations about a product and add this product to cart.

        - Step 4 :
	        When you click on the button 'add to cart', make the AJAX call.

        - Step 5 :
	        When the product is add, update the cart item of your nav/menu


        - Step 6(bonus) :
