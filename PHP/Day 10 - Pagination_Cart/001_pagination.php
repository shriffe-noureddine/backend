	/*
	    -- PAGINATION --
	    To use pagination we'll use LIMIT and OFFSET in SQL

	    This query will select only the 30 first records : SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 30;

		We can also get 30 records, starting from the 31 :
	    SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 30 OFFSET 31;

		(The SQL query below says "return only 30 records, start on record 31 (OFFSET 31)")

		Other syntax, faster :
	    SELECT * FROM Orders LIMIT 31, 30;


	   	To use pagination you should use either URI Params or AJAX.
