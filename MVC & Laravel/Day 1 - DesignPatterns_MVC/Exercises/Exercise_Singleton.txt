- Exercice :

We resume the exercise, seen previously, dealing with the bank account and withdrawal / deposit.
So we have a "BankAccount" class that has an account number, a balance and a cap.
This class will also allow the withdrawal and deposit.

From there, we must design a class of Log, call the 'LogBank'.
This class will have to allow to write in a text file (ecrireLog) and to display the contents of this file (to displayLog).

This Log system will not necessarily be limited to operations on the bank account but potentially will be used for something else. That's why this log system will have to respect the Singleton design pattern.

When a withdrawal or deposit takes place in a bank account, the transactions must be recorded.

It will be necessary to create a small program that will deposit money in a bank account, then withdraw money from the same account.
Finally, it will display the full log.
