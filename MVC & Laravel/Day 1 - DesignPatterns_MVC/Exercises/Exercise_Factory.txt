- Exercise 1 :

Create a dog / cat / bird factory.
Each animal has a cry / noise.

Create a program that asks the user if he prefers dogs, cats or birds.
Depending on what the user responds to, use the factory to dynamically create an object of the correct type and make it do noise.

- Exercise 2 :

We have a client who hold a Pizzeria.
We need a program that separates the creation of a Pizza and the preparation / ordering of a pizza.

There are several types of pizza: cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, pizza 4 seasons etc ...
We have a factory that creates Pizzas.
We also have our Shop Pizzeria which will allow him to order a pizza.
The order of a pizza follows this order: we create our pizza, we prepare the pizza, we cook it and put it in a box.

Create a program that asks the customer which pizza he wants to order (you can show him the available choices). The customer will order the pizza at our pizzeria shop.
