In this exercises, we will use the 'series' table.


- Retrieve all series and movies (in one set of results) with name of director.
	SELECT *
	FROM movies

	UNION

	SELECT *
	FROM series

- Retrieve all series and movies from 2018 with nationality.
	SELECT title, nationality
	FROM movies m
	INNER JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = m.director_id

	UNION

	SELECT title, nationality
	FROM series s
	INNER JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = s.director_id

- Get the number of views per director (movies and series combined). Print the name of the director.
	
	SELECT d.director_id, name, SUM(t.views)
	FROM (
		SELECT *
		FROM movies

		UNION

		SELECT *
		FROM series
	) tempTable t
	INNER JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = t.director_id
	GROUP BY d.director_id

- Get the number of views per director (movies and series separated). Print the name of the director.
	
	SELECT d.director_id, name, Concat('Movies : ', SUM(views)) AS SumViews
	FROM movies m
	INNER JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = m.director_id
	GROUP BY d.director_id

	UNION
	
	SELECT d.director_id, name, Concat('Series : ', SUM(views)) AS SumViews
	FROM series s
	INNER JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = s.director_id
	GROUP BY d.director_id
